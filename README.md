I was very glad to have you after such a long time. Can you plan a meetup? Maybe this weekend?

Home sweet home! I'm glad you are back. It's been two year and miss the football matches we have together. A lot has been changed since you left. Let's meet at the ground tomorrow evening? 

Old rivalry! Consider me in ;-)

Hey bud, welcome back to home. It's so long to see you back again. Would love to hear the travelling stories of yours. Your or my place?

Thank you all
